This is something between a clone and a port of Konoko and Monorail's
CityBinder 0.76 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/citybinder/), using the
Wxpython Widget UI toolkit so that it's cross-platform.

Currently it does very little -- it'll display the main window, and some of
the ui elements sort of work.  It can partially save and load profiles,
and the bindfiles for the Inspiration Popper will actually work.

All that said, there's a long way to go.

The intent is to make this available pre-rolled into standalone
binaries for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

BindControl is licensed under the GPL, version 3 or later.
