        <h1>Pet Select Binds (not yet implemented)</h1>
        <p>These binds enable a system of pet selection that includes next / previous keybinds.  This is useful, for instance,
        for players wishing to buff each pet without having to select each one directly.</p>
        <p>Increase / Decrease Pet Group Size is necessary because keybinds have no way of knowing your group size, and therefore
        are not able to "wrap around" from the last pet to the first without being told the size of the group.</p>
