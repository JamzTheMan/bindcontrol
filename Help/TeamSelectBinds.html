        <h1>Team Select Binds (not yet implemented)</h1>
        <p>These binds enable a system of teammate selection that includes next / previous keybinds.  This is useful, for instance,
        for players wishing to buff each member of their team without having to select each member directly.</p>
        <p>Increase / Decrease Team Size is necessary because keybinds have no way of knowing your team size, and therefore are not
        able to "wrap around" from the last teammate to the first without being told the size of the team.</p>
        <p>Increase / Decrease Team Position <i>TODO</i></p>
        <p>Reset Team Rotation will reset the binds such that "Select Next Teammate" will start over at the first team member.</p>
