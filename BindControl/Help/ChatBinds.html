        <h1>Chat Binds</h1>
        <p>These binds enable you to start typing into the chat window in various ways, optionally with an in-game "typing" notifier.</p>
        <p>All of the binds act the same as the default City of Heroes bindings, but the BindControl versions can display the
        typing notifier.</p>
        <p>The typing notifier is text that will appear over the character's head when the bind is pressed.  This text is created via
        the /afk mechanism, and so will also be sent back to players sending you a private /tell while it is active.</p>
        <p>Enabling these binds without enabling the typing notifier will cause them to act identically to the default City of Heroes
        behavior, so in this case, this is just a convenient way to bind these functions to non-default keys.</p>
